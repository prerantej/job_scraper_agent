# 🤖 Job Scraper Agent (Streamlit + Python)

This project is a functional and minimal **job scraping AI agent**, built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping.

It currently scrapes **remote developer jobs from RemoteOK** and provides:
- Live scraping with one click
- Filtering by keyword and location
- Download as CSV
- Ready to expand into a full AI assistant (e.g., for resume suggestions, auto-apply, summarizing job descriptions)

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🕵️‍♀️ Scrapes job listings from [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/)
- 🧠 Built to evolve into an AI Agent:
  - Will include NLP to analyze job descriptions
  - Recommend jobs based on user profiles
- 📊 Filter and view jobs directly in the browser
- 💾 Download results as a CSV
- 🌐 Deployable via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
